# Patient-Readmission-Prediction-Model
This repository will develop a machine learning model to predict patient readmission rates. Utilizing advanced feature engineering and predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to identify key risk factors and improve healthcare outcomes. Data will be sourced from Kaggle, and model performance will be evaluated for real-world effectiveness.
